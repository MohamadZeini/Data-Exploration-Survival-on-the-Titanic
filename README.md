# Project: Data Exploration (Survival on the Titanic)
## Data Analysis

To see the project refer to `P2.ipynb` file.

### Overview

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this study, the main question is what sorts of people were likely to survive. We will use the data to answer the stated question. We are going to analyze the observational differences and draw some tentative conclusions.

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 2.7 installer and not the Python 3.x installer. 

### Code

Template code is provided in the `Bay_Area_Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb` notebook file. You will also be required to use the included `babs_visualizations.py` Python file and the `babs_y1_y2_summary.csv` dataset file to complete your work. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project. Note that the code included in `babs_visualizations.py` is meant to be used out-of-the-box and not intended for students to manipulate. If you are interested in how the visualizations are created in the notebook, please feel free to explore this Python file.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `Data-Exploration-Survival-on-the-Titanic/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook P2.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook P2.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
